# Project 1 (WWE Quiz game)

![Logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/WWE_official_logo.svg) Quiz Game


- The reason I wanted to do a quiz game on WWE is because I have always loved watching wreslting since I was a little kid and I knew that make a quiz game after something I love would be a great game.
- My game will have 2 categories of WWE questions and if the user gets more than 5 answers wrong they lose.
- If the user gets the rest correct they win the game.
